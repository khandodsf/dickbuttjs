# Dickbutt.js

## Turn text into a dickbutt ASCII art text blob and image

Uses canvas and a character map to convert the text to match the shape of the ubiquitous dickbutt drawing. Colors can be added to style the characters of the text. Each color will be cycled through one character at a time.

Generates a text and image version. Only the image version will have color enhancement.

## TODO

* Store data to display a gallery of previously submitted dickbutts
* Create a download link for the image
